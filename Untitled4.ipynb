      "Preamble: The University of Massachusetts Boston (\"University\") is in an urban 21st Century research setting, and is therefore an inseparable part of the local community and surrounding neighborhoods. The Code of Conduct (the \"Code\") is established to set clear community standards of respect for persons, property, the University community, and the process and procedures addressing unacceptable conduct in which these standards will be governed. This Code reflects the University's mission and identity, and it exists to maintain and protect an environment conducive to learning. Consistent with that purpose, reasonable efforts will be made to take an educational approach to address violations of University policies in order to assist students in learning from their mistakes and understanding how their behavior impacts others while the University maintains the welfare of the community as a whole. The Code is set forth in writing to give students general notice of prohibited conduct. The descriptions of prohibited conduct should be read broadly and are not designed to define expectations or misconduct in exhaustive terms. \n",
      "Because the Code is based on shared values among members of our University community, it sets a broad range of expectations for students no matter where or when their conduct may take place. Generally, the Code is not limited to behavior within the formal boundaries of the University premises. Therefore, the University reserves the right to take necessary and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the University community, to protect the continuing operation of the University, and to serve as a model representative of the greater Boston community. \n",
      "Each student and Student Organization is responsible for reading, reviewing, and abiding by the standards of conduct set forth in the Code, as well as the rules, regulations, policies, and procedures contained in other official University publications and announcements. Notification of a Code violation or decision of a Code violation is issued to a student through the students University email account.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Expectations \n",
      "Each member of the University community enjoys the same basic rights and is expected to respect the rights of others. Those rights include but are not limited to: \n",
      ". freedom from personal abuse and threats of violence; \n",
      ". access to all University services, programs, and activities; \n",
      ". a supportive learning environment that enables all to participate fully within the University. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Membership in the University community is a privilege for those who are invited to join. Becoming a student brings a responsibility to adhere to the values of the University community. Some of these core values include: \n",
      ". Maximizing teaching and learning relationships; \n",
      ". Promoting personal and professional growth; \n",
      ". Fostering the Universitys responsibility to the public; \n",
      ". Increasing diversity and global awareness;  \n",
      ". Serving as an agent of social justice. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "University students and Student Organizations, teams, and groups who breach the trust and values extended to them by violating University policy(ies), shall be held accountable for their actions. The Code defines the responsibilities of students and provides a process for responding to allegations of student misconduct in a way that accords with the values of the University. \n",
      "Part I: Student Conduct Authority \n",
      "Ultimate authority for student discipline is vested in the Board of Trustees of the University of Massachusetts. Disciplinary authority is delegated to the Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Boston, who in turn has delegated authority over student conduct to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and authority for student academic dishonesty to the Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. \n",
      "The University reserves the right to change the provisions of the Code in accordance with University policies or the law whenever such action is deemed appropriate or necessary. The University will publish such amendments in relevant campus publications and on the Office of the Dean of Students website. \n",
      "Questions, comments, and suggestions, should be forwarded to the Office of the Dean of Students. The Code may be reviewed annually by the Office of the Dean of Students. \n",

      "Part II: Definitions: The following selected terms are defined in an effort to facilitate a more thorough understanding of the Code. This list is not intended to be a complete list of all the terms referenced in the Code that might require interpretation or clarification. The Dean of Students, or designee, shall make the final determination on the definition of any term found in the Code. \n",

      " \n",
      "7. \"Coercion\" is the use of an unreasonable amount of pressure to engage in sexual activity. Coercion does not begin when the initiator makes an initial sexual advance. Coercion begins when the initiator continues to pressure another, through the use of undue psychological/emotional pressure, alcohol, drugs, threat, intimidation, or force, to engage in sexual behavior, when a reasonable person would realize that the other does not want to engage in sexual activity. \n",

Consent cannot be inferred by silence, passivity, or not resisting; \n",
      "\n",
      ". Consent cannot be implied by a current or previous dating or sexual relationship; \n",
      "\n",
      ". Consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity; \n",

States of incapacitation include, but are not limited to, unconsciousness, sleep, and intoxication. Incapacitation may result from the voluntary or involuntary consumption of alcohol and/or other drugs. Where alcohol or other substances are involved, incapacitation is determined by how the substance impacts a persons decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make informed judgments. A person is not incapacitated merely because the person has been drinking or using drugs. The question of incapacitation is determined on a case-by-case basis using both objective and subjective standards. In evaluating whether a person was incapacitated for purposes of evaluating consent, the University will consider: (1) whether the person initiating the sexual activity knew that their partner was incapacitated; and if not (2) whether a reasonable person in the same situation would have known that their partner was incapacitated; and (3) whether the person initiating the sexual activity \n",

If the faculty member determines after such consultation and investigation that academic dishonesty did not in fact occur, no formal charge of academic dishonesty will be made. \n",

      "2. To initiate formal proceedings, a faculty member who suspects a student of academic dishonesty must inform the student in writing of that fact within ten (10) business days of the discovery of the alleged violation. Such written notice should inform the student of the factual basis for the charge and the specific sanctions the faculty member proposes to impose and any University sanctions he/she may recommend to the Associate Vice Provost of Undergraduate Studies (AVP) or the Dean of Graduate Studies (Dean), as appropriate. The letter should also inform the student that s/he may be subject to University sanctions imposed directly by the AVP/Dean beyond those recommended by the faculty member. The faculty member shall offer to meet with the student and the faculty members chair (in cases involving undergraduate students) or graduate program director (in cases involving graduate students) to discuss the case. No more than ten (10) business days after meeting (or offering to meet) with the student, the faculty member may impose penalties within his/her purview and so inform the AVP/Dean. If the faculty member, after meeting with the student, determines that the student did not commit academic dishonesty, s/he will so inform the student and AVP/Dean in writing. If no penalty has been imposed within the specified timeframe, the charges shall be considered dropped. \n",

At the end of this review, the AVP/Dean may impose additional University sanctions, including but not limited to those listed in Part IV. F. 8 and 9 of the Student Code of Conduct. University sanctions will normally be imposed for violations of an especially serious nature or in cases of repeat offense. \n",

The Provost/Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs will convene an Appeal Panel, consisting of 3 to 4 faculty members and 2 students from the standing membership of the Joint Discipline and Grievance Committee, and instruct the panel to review the case by convening a hearing.
